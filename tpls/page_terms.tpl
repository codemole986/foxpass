          <p><em>3.1 Use of Third Party Offerings.</em> Supplier or third parties may from time to time make Third Party Offerings available to Customer. Any acquisition by Customer of any such Third Party Offerings, and any exchange of data between Customer and any provider of a Third Party Offering, is solely between Customer and the applicable provider of the Third Party Offering. Supplier does not warrant or support any Third Party Offering, whether or not they are designated by Supplier as “certified” or otherwise, except as specified in an Order Form. If Customer installs or enables any Third Party Offering for use with Supplier Services, Customer acknowledges that Supplier may allow providers of that Third Party Offering to access Customer Data as required for the interoperation and support of such Third Party Offering with the Supplier Services. Supplier shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from any such access by the providers of Third Party Offerings.</p>

          <p><em>3.2 Integration with Third Party Offerings.</em> The Supplier Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Third Party Offerings (e.g., Google, Facebook or Twitter applications). To use such features, Customer may be required to obtain access to such Third Party Offering from their providers.

          <p><b>(a) General.</b> Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold Customer harmless from any third party claim or suit brought against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on an claim that the Supplier Services, in the form provided by Supplier, infringes the Intellectual Property Rights of such third party; provided that (a) Customer notifies Supplier in writing within thirty (30) days of the claim, (b) Supplier has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, and (c) Customer provides Supplier with the assistance, information and authority necessary to perform Supplier's obligations under this section. Supplier will have no liability for a claim of infringement based on Customer's use of a superseded or altered release of Supplier Services if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Supplier Services, which Supplier provided or made available to the Customer. The foregoing indemnification obligations of Supplier shall not be applicable in the event the infringement or misappropriation claim in question arises from or is attributable to: (i) compliance with any designs, specifications or instructions Customer hereafter specifically requests Supplier to comply with, (ii) the modification by Customer or any third party of the Supplier Services, (iii) the use of the Supplier Services in combination with other products no provided by Supplier, and (iv) use of the Supplier Services other than in accordance with the Documentation.</p>

          <p><b>(b) Mitigation.</b> If the Supplier Services is alleged to be so infringing, Supplier shall have the right, at its option and expense, to (a) modify the Supplier Services to be noninfringing while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality, or (b) obtain for Customer a license to continue using the Supplier Services. If Supplier determines it is not commercially reasonable to perform either of the foregoing options, Supplier may terminate the license for the infringing Supplier Services and refund any pre-paid or unused portion of the license fees.</p>

          <p><b>(c) Sole Remedy.</b> THIS SECTION STATES SUPPLIER'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>



          <hr/>
          <h4>CONFIDENTIALITY.</h4>
          <p><em>10.1 Confidential Information. "Confidential Information"</em> means any and all non-public technical and non-technical information disclosed by one party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (the "Receiving Party") in any form or medium, whether oral, written, graphical or electronic, pursuant to these Terms, that is marked confidential and proprietary, or that the Disclosing Party identifies as confidential and proprietary, or that by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure or receipt ought to be treated as confidential and proprietary information, including but not limited to: (a) techniques, sketches, drawings, models, inventions (whether or not patented or patentable), know-how, processes, apparatus, formulae, equipment, algorithms, software programs, software source documents, APIs, and other creative works (whether or not copyrighted or copyrightable); (b) information concerning research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications, engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising and marketing plans and information; (c) proprietary or confidential information of any third party who may disclose such information to Disclosing Party or Receiving Party in the course of Disclosing Party's business; and (d) the terms of these Terms and any Order Form. Confidential Information of Supplier shall include the Supplier Service. Confidential Information also includes all summaries and abstracts of Confidential Information.</p>

          <p><em>10.2 Non-Disclosure.</em> Each party acknowledges that in the course of the performance of these Terms, it may obtain the Confidential Information of the other party. The Receiving Party shall, at all times, both during the Term and thereafter, keep in confidence and trust all of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information received by it. The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party other than as necessary to fulfill the Receiving Party's obligations or to exercise the Receiving Party's rights under these Terms. Each party agrees to secure and protect the other party's Confidential Information with the same degree of care and in a manner consistent with the maintenance of such party's own Confidential Information (but in no event less than reasonable care), and to take appropriate action by instruction or agreement with its employees, Affiliates or other agents who are permitted access to the other party's Confidential Information to satisfy its obligations under this section. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person or entity other than its officers, employees, affiliates and agents who need access to such Confidential Information in order to effect the intent of these Terms and who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as the obligations set forth in these Terms.</p>

          <p><em>10.3 Exceptions to Confidential Information.</em> The obligations set forth in Section 10.2 (Non-Disclosure) shall not apply to the extent that Confidential Information includes information which: (a) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party either itself or through receipt directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (b) was developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (c) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except as a result of a breach of these Terms or any obligation of confidentiality by the Receiving Party. Nothing in these Terms shall prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent the Receiving Party is legally compelled to do so by any governmental investigative or judicial agency pursuant to proceedings over which such agency has jurisdiction; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the Receiving Party shall (x) assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to the agency; (y) immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing of the agency's order or request to disclose; and (z) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against any such disclosure and in obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of the compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality.</p>

          <p><em>10.4 Injunctive Relief.</em> The Parties agree that any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information may cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and that, in the event of such breach, the Receiving Party will be entitled, in addition to any other available remedies, to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages.</p>

          <p><em>12.2 Limits on Liability.</em> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SUPPLIER’S LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS (AND CUSTOMER’S PERSONNEL AND AFFILIATES) IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO SUPPLIER, UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT, DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS.</p>
